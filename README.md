Produces generated messages based on a [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). Reads messages from channels to build its model and generate messages both based on individual users and the server as a whole.

**NOT MAINTAINED**
As a result, do not expect code quality to be ideal.
